# classification-enrichment-gene-expression-ARI
The aim of this project was to try different classification techniques in order to distinguish between three types of acute respiratory viral infections (Rhinovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Influenza A) given gene expression signatures and identify genes most affected by these diseases. Some of the developed models show good results in classifying healthy individual vs affected, indicating that Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) induce changes in human gene expression, which can be used to better understand these types of disease and help the diagnostic process.
